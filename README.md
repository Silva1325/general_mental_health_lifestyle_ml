## Project Overview

A machine learning project that uses a linear regression model to predict mental health outcomes based on lifestyle and behavirol factors. With this analysis we can also identify which parameters are the most beneficial and prejudicial for our  emotional well-being.

## Dataset

The dataset chosen for this project is [Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mabubakrsiddiq/general-mental-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data) from Kaggle.

This dataset represents synthetic daily mental health and lifestyle data for general working individuals. It captures realistic patterns of sleep, screen time, exercise, work load, and social interactions that affect mood, stress, and overall productivity.

Each record corresponds to a single day for a hypothetical worker, with features including:

Sleep Hours – total hours slept
Screen Time – daily time spent on digital devices
Exercise Minutes – physical activity per day
Daily Pending Tasks – unfinished work items or responsibilities
Interruptions – number of daily interruptions
Fatigue Level – subjective fatigue rating
Social Hours – time spent interacting with family, friends, or coworkers
Coffee Cups – caffeine intake
Diet Quality – categorical rating of meals: poor, average, or good
Weather – categorical: sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy
Mood Score – daily mood rating (1–10)
Stress Level – daily stress rating (1–10)
